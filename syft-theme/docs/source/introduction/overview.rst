Overview
========

Everyone has questions they want to answer, and society constructs flows of information 
to help the right information reach the right people who need it while preventing information 
from flowing to those who might mis-use it. We call this goal Structured Transparency. 
However, this process is broken in several key ways. Chief among them is the requirement that 
someone must acquire a copy of a piece of data in order to learn insights from it. This creates 
tradeoffs between the benefits of sharing information with someone (innovation, insights, 
scientific discovery, increased accountability, etc.), and the risks that they might mis-use it 
(privacy invasion, IP theft, blackmail, etc.). These tradeoffs mean that sometimes good things 
don’t happen because information can’t be shared, and other times, bad things happen because 
too much information must be shared for some overriding reason.

.. warning::

  Solidity recently released the 0.8.x version that introduced a lot of breaking changes.
  Make sure you read :doc:`the full list <080-breaking-changes>`.

Ideas for improving Solidity or this documentation are always welcome,
read our :doc:`contributors guide <contributing>` for more details.

.. Hint::

  You can download this documentation as PDF, HTML or Epub
  by clicking on the versions flyout menu in the bottom-left corner and selecting the preferred download format.


Getting Started
---------------

**1. Understand the Smart Contract Basics**

If you are new to the concept of smart contracts, we recommend you to get started by digging into the "Introduction to Smart Contracts" section, which covers the following:

* :ref:`A simple example smart contract <simple-smart-contract>` written in Solidity.
* :ref:`Blockchain Basics <blockchain-basics>`.
* :ref:`The Ethereum Virtual Machine <the-ethereum-virtual-machine>`.

**2. Get to Know Solidity**

Once you are accustomed to the basics, we recommend you read the :doc:`"Solidity by Example" <solidity-by-example>`
and “Language Description” sections to understand the core concepts of the language.

**3. Install the Solidity Compiler**

There are various ways to install the Solidity compiler,
simply choose your preferred option and follow the steps outlined on the :ref:`installation page <installing-solidity>`.

.. hint::
  You can try out code examples directly in your browser with the
  `Remix IDE <https://remix.ethereum.org>`_.
  Remix is a web browser-based IDE that allows you to write, deploy and administer Solidity smart contracts,
  without the need to install Solidity locally.

.. warning::
    As humans write software, it can have bugs.
    Therefore, you should follow established software development best practices when writing your smart contracts.
    This includes code review, testing, audits, and correctness proofs.
    Smart contract users are sometimes more confident with code than their authors,
    and blockchains and smart contracts have their own unique issues to watch out for,
    so before working on production code, make sure you read the :ref:`security_considerations` section.

**4. Learn More**

If you want to learn more about building decentralized applications on Ethereum,
the `Ethereum Developer Resources <https://ethereum.org/en/developers/>`_ can help you with further general documentation around Ethereum,
and a wide selection of tutorials, tools, and development frameworks.

If you have any questions, you can try searching for answers or asking on the
`Ethereum StackExchange <https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/>`_,
or our `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity>`_.
